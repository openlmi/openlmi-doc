Filesystem and other data format management.

Usage:
    %(cmd)s list [--all] [ <device> ...]
    %(cmd)s create [ --label=<label> ] <fstype>  <device> ...
    %(cmd)s delete <device> ...
    %(cmd)s list-supported

Commands:
    list        List filesystems and other data formats (RAID metadata,
                ...)  on given devices.
                If no devices are provided, all filesystems are listed.
                If --all option is set, all filesystem, including system
                ones like tmpfs, cgroups, procfs, sysfs etc are listed.

    create      Format device(s) with given filesystem.
                If more devices are given, the filesystem will span
                over these devices (currently supported only by btrfs).

                For list of available filesystem types, see output of
                %(cmd)s list-supported.

    delete      Delete given filesystem or data format (like partition
                table, RAID metadata, LUKS, physical volume metadata etc)
                on given devices.

    list-supported
                List supported filesystems, which can be used as
                %(cmd)s create <fstype> option.
