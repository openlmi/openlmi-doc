.. _LMI-BlockStatisticsService-HealthState:

``uint16`` **HealthState**

    Indicates the current health of the element. This attribute expresses the health of this element but not necessarily that of its subcomponents. The possible values are 0 to 30, where 5 means the element is entirely healthy and 30 means the element is completely non-functional. The following continuum is defined: 

    "Non-recoverable Error" (30) - The element has completely failed, and recovery is not possible. All functionality provided by this element has been lost. 

    "Critical Failure" (25) - The element is non-functional and recovery might not be possible. 

    "Major Failure" (20) - The element is failing. It is possible that some or all of the functionality of this component is degraded or not working. 

    "Minor Failure" (15) - All functionality is available but some might be degraded. 

    "Degraded/Warning" (10) - The element is in working order and all functionality is provided. However, the element is not working to the best of its abilities. For example, the element might not be operating at optimal performance or it might be reporting recoverable errors. 

    "OK" (5) - The element is fully functional and is operating within normal operational parameters and without error. 

    "Unknown" (0) - The implementation cannot report on HealthState at this time. 

    DMTF has reserved the unused portion of the continuum for additional HealthStates in the future.

.. _LMI-BlockStatisticsService-Started:

``boolean`` **Started**

    Started is a Boolean that indicates whether the Service has been started (TRUE), or stopped (FALSE).

    
.. _LMI-BlockStatisticsService-PrimaryStatus:

``uint16`` **PrimaryStatus**

    PrimaryStatus provides a high level status value, intended to align with Red-Yellow-Green type representation of status. It should be used in conjunction with DetailedStatus to provide high level and detailed health status of the ManagedElement and its subcomponents. 

    PrimaryStatus consists of one of the following values: Unknown, OK, Degraded or Error. "Unknown" indicates the implementation is in general capable of returning this property, but is unable to do so at this time. 

    "OK" indicates the ManagedElement is functioning normally. 

    "Degraded" indicates the ManagedElement is functioning below normal. 

    "Error" indicates the ManagedElement is in an Error condition.

.. _LMI-BlockStatisticsService-EnabledState:

``uint16`` **EnabledState**

    EnabledState is an integer enumeration that indicates the enabled and disabled states of an element. It can also indicate the transitions between these requested states. For example, shutting down (value=4) and starting (value=10) are transient states between enabled and disabled. The following text briefly summarizes the various enabled and disabled states: 

    Enabled (2) indicates that the element is or could be executing commands, will process any queued commands, and queues new requests. 

    Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests. 

    Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state. 

    Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled. 

    Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests. 

    Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. 

    Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. 

    Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode.

    Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued.

.. _LMI-BlockStatisticsService-StartMode:

``string`` **StartMode**

    Note: The use of this element is deprecated in lieu of the EnabledDefault property that is inherited from EnabledLogicalElement. The EnabledLogicalElement addresses the same semantics. The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property. To remain compatible with those implementations, StartMode was grandfathered into the schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property but also permits an improved, clarified definition using EnabledDefault. 

    Deprecated description: StartMode is a string value that indicates whether the Service is automatically started by a System, an Operating System, and so on, or is started only upon request.

    
.. _LMI-BlockStatisticsService-OperationalStatus:

``uint16[]`` **OperationalStatus**

    Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 

    "Stressed" indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of "Stressed" states are overload, overheated, and so on. 

    "Predictive Failure" indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 

    "In Service" describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 

    "No Contact" indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 

    "Lost Communication" indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 

    "Stopped" and "Aborted" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 

    "Dormant" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 

    "Supporting Entity in Error" indicates that this element might be "OK" but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 

    "Completed" indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 

    "Power Mode" indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. 

    "Relocating" indicates the element is being relocated.

    OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element.

    .. _LMI-BlockStatisticsService-GetStatisticsCollection:

``uint32`` **GetStatisticsCollection** (:ref:`CIM_ConcreteJob <CIM-ConcreteJob>` Job, ``uint16[]`` ElementTypes, :ref:`CIM_BlockStatisticsManifestCollection <CIM-BlockStatisticsManifestCollection>` ManifestCollection, ``uint16`` StatisticsFormat, ``string[]`` Statistics)

    Retrieves statistics in a well-defined bulk format. The collection of statistics returned is determined by the list of element types passed in to the method and the manifests for those types contained in the supplied BlockStatisticsManifestCollection. If both the Elements and BlockStatisticsManifestCollection parameters are supplied, then the types of elements returned is an intersection of the element types listed in the Elements parameter and the types for which BlockStatisticsManifest instances exist in the supplied BlockStatisticsManifestCollection. The statistics are returned through a well-defined array of strings, whose format is specified by the StatisticsFormat parameter, that can be parsed to retrieve the desired statistics as well as limited information about the elements that those metrics describe.

If the array is not null, but is empty, then no statistics will be returned by this method. A client SHOULD NOT specify this parameter if it is not meaningful (i.e. the service only provides statistics for a single type of element).
