.. _LMI-SoftwareInstallationService-RequestedState:

``uint16`` **RequestedState**

    RequestedState is an integer enumeration that indicates the last requested or desired state for the element, irrespective of the mechanism through which it was requested. The actual state of the element is represented by EnabledState. This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ("Not Applicable"), then this property has no meaning. Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. 

    "Unknown" (0) indicates the last requested state for the element is unknown.

    Note that the value "No Change" (5) has been deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is "Unknown" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState should have the value "Unknown" (0), but may have the value "No Change" (5).Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState. 

    It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are "Reboot" (10) and "Reset" (11). Reboot refers to doing a "Shut Down" and then moving to an "Enabled" state. Reset indicates that the element is first "Disabled" and then "Enabled". The distinction between requesting "Shut Down" and "Disabled" should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. 

    

    This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. 

    

    If knowledge of the last RequestedState is not supported for the EnabledLogicalElement, the property shall be NULL or have the value 12 "Not Applicable".

.. _LMI-SoftwareInstallationService-HealthState:

``uint16`` **HealthState**

    Indicates the current health of the element. This attribute expresses the health of this element but not necessarily that of its subcomponents. The possible values are 0 to 30, where 5 means the element is entirely healthy and 30 means the element is completely non-functional. The following continuum is defined: 

    "Non-recoverable Error" (30) - The element has completely failed, and recovery is not possible. All functionality provided by this element has been lost. 

    "Critical Failure" (25) - The element is non-functional and recovery might not be possible. 

    "Major Failure" (20) - The element is failing. It is possible that some or all of the functionality of this component is degraded or not working. 

    "Minor Failure" (15) - All functionality is available but some might be degraded. 

    "Degraded/Warning" (10) - The element is in working order and all functionality is provided. However, the element is not working to the best of its abilities. For example, the element might not be operating at optimal performance or it might be reporting recoverable errors. 

    "OK" (5) - The element is fully functional and is operating within normal operational parameters and without error. 

    "Unknown" (0) - The implementation cannot report on HealthState at this time. 

    DMTF has reserved the unused portion of the continuum for additional HealthStates in the future.

.. _LMI-SoftwareInstallationService-InstanceID:

``string`` **InstanceID**

    InstanceID is an optional property that may be used to opaquely and uniquely identify an instance of this class within the scope of the instantiating Namespace. Various subclasses of this class may override this property to make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness that are defined below.

    To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following "preferred" algorithm: 

    <OrgID>:<LocalID> 

    Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 

    <LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If not null and the above "preferred" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. 

    If not set to null for DMTF-defined instances, the "preferred" algorithm must be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM.

    
.. _LMI-SoftwareInstallationService-CommunicationStatus:

``uint16`` **CommunicationStatus**

    CommunicationStatus indicates the ability of the instrumentation to communicate with the underlying ManagedElement. CommunicationStatus consists of one of the following values: Unknown, None, Communication OK, Lost Communication, or No Contact. 

    A Null return indicates the implementation (provider) does not implement this property. 

    "Unknown" indicates the implementation is in general capable of returning this property, but is unable to do so at this time. 

    "Not Available" indicates that the implementation (provider) is capable of returning a value for this property, but not ever for this particular piece of hardware/software or the property is intentionally not used because it adds no meaningful information (as in the case of a property that is intended to add additional info to another property). 

    "Communication OK " indicates communication is established with the element, but does not convey any quality of service. 

    "No Contact" indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 

    "Lost Communication" indicates that the Managed Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable.

``uint16`` **DetailedStatus**

    DetailedStatus compliments PrimaryStatus with additional status detail. It consists of one of the following values: Not Available, No Additional Information, Stressed, Predictive Failure, Error, Non-Recoverable Error, SupportingEntityInError. Detailed status is used to expand upon the PrimaryStatus of the element. 

    A Null return indicates the implementation (provider) does not implement this property. 

    "Not Available" indicates that the implementation (provider) is capable of returning a value for this property, but not ever for this particular piece of hardware/software or the property is intentionally not used because it adds no meaningful information (as in the case of a property that is intended to add additional info to another property). 

    "No Additional Information" indicates that the element is functioning normally as indicated by PrimaryStatus = "OK". 

    "Stressed" indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of "Stressed" states are overload, overheated, and so on. 

    "Predictive Failure" indicates that an element is functioning normally but a failure is predicted in the near future. 

    "Non-Recoverable Error " indicates that this element is in an error condition that requires human intervention. 

    "Supporting Entity in Error" indicates that this element might be "OK" but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems.

.. _LMI-SoftwareInstallationService-EnabledState:

``uint16`` **EnabledState**

    EnabledState is an integer enumeration that indicates the enabled and disabled states of an element. It can also indicate the transitions between these requested states. For example, shutting down (value=4) and starting (value=10) are transient states between enabled and disabled. The following text briefly summarizes the various enabled and disabled states: 

    Enabled (2) indicates that the element is or could be executing commands, will process any queued commands, and queues new requests. 

    Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests. 

    Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state. 

    Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled. 

    Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests. 

    Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. 

    Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. 

    Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode.

    Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued.

.. _LMI-SoftwareInstallationService-PrimaryStatus:

``uint16`` **PrimaryStatus**

    PrimaryStatus provides a high level status value, intended to align with Red-Yellow-Green type representation of status. It should be used in conjunction with DetailedStatus to provide high level and detailed health status of the ManagedElement and its subcomponents. 

    PrimaryStatus consists of one of the following values: Unknown, OK, Degraded or Error. "Unknown" indicates the implementation is in general capable of returning this property, but is unable to do so at this time. 

    "OK" indicates the ManagedElement is functioning normally. 

    "Degraded" indicates the ManagedElement is functioning below normal. 

    "Error" indicates the ManagedElement is in an Error condition.

``uint16[]`` **OperationalStatus**

    Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 

    "Stressed" indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of "Stressed" states are overload, overheated, and so on. 

    "Predictive Failure" indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 

    "In Service" describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 

    "No Contact" indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 

    "Lost Communication" indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 

    "Stopped" and "Aborted" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 

    "Dormant" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 

    "Supporting Entity in Error" indicates that this element might be "OK" but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 

    "Completed" indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 

    "Power Mode" indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. 

    "Relocating" indicates the element is being relocated.

    OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element.

.. _LMI-SoftwareInstallationService-OperatingStatus:

``uint16`` **OperatingStatus**

    OperatingStatus provides a current status value for the operational condition of the element and can be used for providing more detail with respect to the value of EnabledState. It can also provide the transitional states when an element is transitioning from one state to another, such as when an element is transitioning between EnabledState and RequestedState, as well as other transitional conditions.

    OperatingStatus consists of one of the following values: Unknown, Not Available, In Service, Starting, Stopping, Stopped, Aborted, Dormant, Completed, Migrating, Emmigrating, Immigrating, Snapshotting. Shutting Down, In Test 

    A Null return indicates the implementation (provider) does not implement this property. 

    "Unknown" indicates the implementation is in general capable of returning this property, but is unable to do so at this time. 

    "None" indicates that the implementation (provider) is capable of returning a value for this property, but not ever for this particular piece of hardware/software or the property is intentionally not used because it adds no meaningful information (as in the case of a property that is intended to add additional info to another property). 

    "Servicing" describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 

    "Starting" describes an element being initialized. 

    "Stopping" describes an element being brought to an orderly stop. 

    "Stopped" and "Aborted" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 

    "Dormant" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 

    "Completed" indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded in the PrimaryStatus so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 

    "Migrating" element is being moved between host elements. 

    "Immigrating" element is being moved to new host element. 

    "Emigrating" element is being moved away from host element. 

    "Shutting Down" describes an element being brought to an abrupt stop. 

    "In Test" element is performing test functions. 

    "Transitioning" describes an element that is between states, that is, it is not fully available in either its previous state or its next state. This value should be used if other values indicating a transition to a specific state are not applicable.

    "In Service" describes an element that is in service and operational.

    Note that this method is provided to support existing, alternative download mechanisms (such as used for firmware download). The 'normal' mechanism will be to use the InstallFromSoftwareIdentity method.

    If 0 is returned, the function completed successfully and no ConcreteJob instance was required. If 4096/0x1000 is returned, a ConcreteJob will be started to to perform the install. The Job's reference will be returned in the output parameter Job.

    This method allows a client application to determine whether a specific SoftwareIdentity can be installed (or updated) on a ManagedElement. It also allows other characteristics to be determined such as whether install will require a reboot. In addition a client can check whether the SoftwareIdentity can be added simulataneously to a specified SofwareIndentityCollection. A client MAY specify either or both of the Collection and Target parameters. The Collection parameter is only supported if SoftwareInstallationServiceCapabilities.CanAddToCollection is TRUE.

        *IN* ``string[]`` **InstallOptionsValues**
            InstallOptionsValues is an array of strings providing additional information to InstallOptions for the method to install the software. Each entry of this array is related to the entry in InstallOptions that is located at the same index providing additional information for InstallOptions. 

            If the index in InstallOptions has the value "Password " then a value at the corresponding index of InstallOptionValues shall not be NULL. 

            If the index in InstallOptions has the value "ScheduleInstallAt" then the value at the corresponding index of InstallOptionValues shall not be NULL and shall be in the datetime type format. 

            If the index in InstallOptions has the value "Log " then a value at the corresponding index of InstallOptionValues may be NULL. 

            If the index in InstallOptions has the value "Defer target/system reset", "Force installation","Install", "Update", "Repair" or "Reboot" then a value at the corresponding index of InstallOptionValues shall be NULL.

            
        
        *IN* :ref:`CIM_SoftwareIdentity <CIM-SoftwareIdentity>` **Source**
            Reference to the source of the install.

            
        
        *IN* :ref:`CIM_ManagedElement <CIM-ManagedElement>` **Target**
            The installation target. If NULL then the SOftwareIdentity will be added to Collection only. The underlying implementation is expected to be able to obtain any necessary metadata from the Software Identity.

            
        
        *IN* :ref:`CIM_Collection <CIM-Collection>` **Collection**
            Reference to the Collection to which the Software Identity SHALL be added. If NULL then the Software Identity will not be added to a Collection.

    Start a job to verify installed package represented by SoftwareIdentity (Source) on a ManagedElement (Target).

    If 0 is returned, the function completed successfully and no ConcreteJob instance was required. If 4096/0x1000 is returned, a ConcreteJob will be started to perform the verification. The Job's reference will be returned in the output parameter Job.

    In former case, the Failed parameterwill contain all associated file checks, that did not pass. In the latter case this property will be NULL.
