Subclass of :ref:`CIM_Job <CIM-Job>`

A concrete version of Job. This class represents a generic and instantiable unit of work, such as a batch or a print job.


Key properties

| :ref:`InstanceID <CIM-ConcreteJob-InstanceID>`

Local properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _CIM-ConcreteJob-InstanceID:

``string`` **InstanceID**

    Within the scope of the instantiating Namespace, InstanceID opaquely and uniquely identifies an instance of this class. In order to ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed using the following 'preferred' algorithm: 

    <OrgID>:<LocalID> 

    Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon ':', and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID, or that is a registered ID that is assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness <OrgID> must not contain a colon (':'). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 

    <LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be re-used to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not re-used across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. 

    For DMTF defined instances, the 'preferred' algorithm must be used with the <OrgID> set to 'CIM'.

    
.. _CIM-ConcreteJob-JobOutParameters:

``string`` **JobOutParameters**

    The output (including inout), parameters of the job, formatted as an embedded instance with a class name of "__JobOutParameters".

    

    This property shall be NULL unless JobStatus has the value Completed (7).

    

    In the case where a job represents an intrinsic operation or an extrinsic method call, that embedded instance contains properties representing the output parameters and return value of that call. Each output parameter is mapped to a corresponding property of the same name and type, and the return value is mapped to a property with the name __ReturnValue of the same type. REF-typed parameters and return values are mapped to Reference-qualified properties of type string whose value is the instance path in WBEM URI format.

    

    The value of each such property shall be the value of the corresponding output parameter or return value at the time the job completed.

    
.. _CIM-ConcreteJob-MethodName:

``string`` **MethodName**

    If not NULL, the name of the intrinsic operation or extrinsic method for which this Job represents an invocation.

    When not NULL, and if an extrinsic method, the format shall be <classPath>.MethodName, where classPath is a WBEM-URI-TypedClassPath or a WBEM-URI-UntypedClassPath as defined by DSP0207. And where methodName is a method of that class.

    When not NULL, and if an intrinsic operation, the format shall be <namespacePath>.OperationName, where namespacePath is a WBEM-URI-TypedNamespacePath or a WBEM-URI-UntypedNamespacePath as defined by DSP0207. And where OperationName is either the name of a generic operation as defined in DSP0223 or is the name of a protocol specific operation as defined for the protocol used to retrieve the instance.

    
.. _CIM-ConcreteJob-TimeOfLastStateChange:

``datetime`` **TimeOfLastStateChange**

    The date or time when the state of the Job last changed. If the state of the Job has not changed and this property is populated, then it must be set to a 0 interval value. If a state change was requested, but rejected or not yet processed, the property must not be updated.

    
.. _CIM-ConcreteJob-TimeBeforeRemoval:

``datetime`` **TimeBeforeRemoval**

    The amount of time that the Job is retained after it has finished executing, either succeeding or failing in that execution. The job must remain in existence for some period of time regardless of the value of the DeleteOnCompletion property. 

    The default is five minutes.

    
.. _CIM-ConcreteJob-Name:

``string`` **Name**

    The user-friendly name for this instance of a Job. In addition, the user-friendly name can be used as a property for a search or query. (Note: Name does not have to be unique within a namespace.)

    
.. _CIM-ConcreteJob-DeleteOnCompletion:

``boolean`` **DeleteOnCompletion**

    Indicates whether or not the job should be automatically deleted upon completion. Note that the 'completion' of a job includes when the Job is terminated by manual intervention. 

    If this property is set to false and the job completes, then the intrinsic method DeleteInstance must be used to delete the job instead of updating this property.

    If this property is set to true and the job completes, then the job may be deleted after the TimeBeforeRemoval interval.

    If there is a CIM_DiagnosticServiceJobCapabilities associated to the service that spawned the job, then the DeleteOnCompletion should be TRUE if CIM_DiagnosticServiceJobCapabilities.DeleteJobSupported is FALSE. If DeleteOnCompletion is FALSE, then CIM_DiagnosticServiceJobCapabilities.CleanupInterval should be non-NULL.

    
.. _CIM-ConcreteJob-JobState:

``uint16`` **JobState**

    JobState is an integer enumeration that indicates the operational state of a Job. It can also indicate transitions between these states, for example, 'Shutting Down' and 'Starting'. Following is a brief description of the states: 

    New (2) indicates that the job has never been started. 

    Starting (3) indicates that the job is moving from the 'New', 'Suspended', or 'Service' states into the 'Running' state. 

    Running (4) indicates that the Job is running. 

    Suspended (5) indicates that the Job is stopped, but can be restarted in a seamless manner. 

    Shutting Down (6) indicates that the job is moving to a 'Completed', 'Terminated', or 'Killed' state. 

    Completed (7) indicates that the job has completed normally. 

    Terminated (8) indicates that the job has been stopped by a 'Terminate' state change request. The job and all its underlying processes are ended and can be restarted (this is job-specific) only as a new job. 

    Killed (9) indicates that the job has been stopped by a 'Kill' state change request. Underlying processes might have been left running, and cleanup might be required to free up resources. 

    Exception (10) indicates that the Job is in an abnormal state that might be indicative of an error condition. Actual status might be displayed though job-specific objects. 

    Service (11) indicates that the Job is in a vendor-specific state that supports problem discovery, or resolution, or both.

    Query pending (12) waiting for a client to resolve a query

.. _CIM-ConcreteJob-JobInParameters:

``string`` **JobInParameters**

    The input (including inout), parameters of the job, formatted as an embedded instance with a class name of "__JobInParameters".

    In the case where a job represents an intrinsic operation or an extrinsic method call, that embedded instance contains properties representing the input parameters of that call. Each input parameter is mapped to a corresponding property of the same name and type. REF-typed parameters are represented as Reference-qualified properties of type string whose value is the instance path in WBEM URI format.

    The value of each property shall be the value of the corresponding input parameter at the time the job was started.

    

Local methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. _CIM-ConcreteJob-RequestStateChange:

``uint32`` **RequestStateChange** (``uint16`` RequestedState, ``datetime`` TimeoutPeriod)

    Requests that the state of the job be changed to the value specified in the RequestedState parameter. Invoking the RequestStateChange method multiple times could result in earlier requests being overwritten or lost. 

    If 0 is returned, then the task completed successfully. Any other return code indicates an error condition.

    **Parameters**
    
        *IN* ``uint16`` **RequestedState**
            RequestStateChange changes the state of a job. The possible values are as follows: 

            Start (2) changes the state to 'Running'. 

            Suspend (3) stops the job temporarily. The intention is to subsequently restart the job with 'Start'. It might be possible to enter the 'Service' state while suspended. (This is job-specific.) 

            Terminate (4) stops the job cleanly, saving data, preserving the state, and shutting down all underlying processes in an orderly manner. 

            Kill (5) terminates the job immediately with no requirement to save data or preserve the state. 

            Service (6) puts the job into a vendor-specific service state. It might be possible to restart the job.

        *IN* ``datetime`` **TimeoutPeriod**
            A timeout period that specifies the maximum amount of time that the client expects the transition to the new state to take. The interval format must be used to specify the TimeoutPeriod. A value of 0 or a null parameter indicates that the client has no time requirements for the transition. 

            If this property does not contain 0 or null and the implementation does not support this parameter, a return code of 'Use Of Timeout Parameter Not Supported' must be returned.

            
        
    
    .. _CIM-ConcreteJob-ResumeWithAction:

``uint32`` **ResumeWithAction** ()

    The CIM_ConcreteJob.ResumeWithAction( ) method is invoked to resume the execution of a job when it has a JobState of 12 (Query Pending) and an action (rather than input) was requested. The pending query is a request to perform an action and the job program merely needs to know when the action is completed.

    The job would request the action(s) through one or more indications. When an indication has been sent, but there has not been a client response the job will have a JobState of Query Pending.

    .. _CIM-ConcreteJob-GetError:

``uint32`` **GetError** (``string`` Error)

    GetError is deprecated because Error should be an array,not a scalar.

    When the job is executing or has terminated without error, then this method returns no CIM_Error instance. However, if the job has failed because of some internal problem or because the job has been terminated by a client, then a CIM_Error instance is returned.

        *OUT* ``string`` **Error**
            If the OperationalStatus on the Job is not "OK", then this method will return a CIM Error instance. Otherwise, when the Job is "OK", null is returned.

            
        
    
    .. _CIM-ConcreteJob-ResumeWithInput:

``uint32`` **ResumeWithInput** (``string[]`` Inputs)

    The CIM_ConcreteJob.ResumeWithInput( ) method is invoked to resume the execution of the job when it has a JobState of 12 (Query Pending). The input parameters specify an array of strings that constitute the client supplied inputs to the job program. 

    The job would request the inputs through one or more indications. When an indication has been sent, but there has not been a client response the job will have a JobState of Query Pending.

    **Parameters**
    
        *IN* ``string[]`` **Inputs**
            The input values requested of the client by the job when its state changed to 12 (Query Pending).

            If the CIM_ConcreteJob is associated with a CIM_DiagnosticTest, then the CIM_DiagnosticTest.Characteristics property shall contain 3 (Is Interactive).

            If the CIM_ConcreteJob is associated with a CIM_DiagnosticTest and a corresponding CIM_DiagnosticServiceJobCapabilities exists, then CIM_DiagnosticServiceJobCapabilities.ClientRetriesMax identifies the number of times this method may be retried and CIM_DiagnosticServiceJobCapabilities.DefaultValuesSupported identifies the whether or not default input values are supported.

            If the CIM_ConcreteJob instance is executing under the control of a CIM_JobSettingData, then CIM_JobSettingData.DefaultInputValues shall identify the Default input values to be used if default input values are supported, CIM_JobSettingData.InteractiveTimeout identifies the amount of time to wait for a client to issue the ResumeWithInput and CIM_JobSettingData.ClientRetries identifies the number of retries of the method that the client may execute.

            
        
    
    .. _CIM-ConcreteJob-GetErrors:

``uint32`` **GetErrors** (``string[]`` Errors)

    If JobState is "Completed" and Operational Status is "Completed" then no instance of CIM_Error is returned. 

    If JobState is "Exception" then GetErrors may return intances of CIM_Error related to the execution of the procedure or method invoked by the job.

    If Operatational Status is not "OK" or "Completed"then GetErrors may return CIM_Error instances related to the running of the job.
