Local properties

.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-SQETestErrors:

``uint32`` **SQETestErrors**

    The number of times that the SQE TEST ERROR message is generated by the PLS sublayer for a particular interface. The SQE TEST ERROR message is defined in section 7.2.2.2.4 of ANSI/IEEE 802.3-1985 and its generation is described in section 7.2.4.6 of the same document.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-MultipleCollisionFrames:

``uint32`` **MultipleCollisionFrames**

    The number of successfully transmitted frames on a particular interface for which transmission is inhibited by more than one collision. A frame that is counted by an instance of this object is not counted by the corresponding instance of the SingleCollisionFrames property.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-CarrierSenseErrors:

``uint32`` **CarrierSenseErrors**

    The number of times that the carrier sense condition was lost or never asserted when attempting to transmit a frame on a particular interface. The count represented by an instance of this object can be incremented only once per transmission attempt, even if the carrier sense condition fluctuates during a transmission attempt.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-LateCollisions:

``uint32`` **LateCollisions**

    The number of times that a collision is detected on a particular interface later than 512 bit-times into the transmission of a packet. Five hundred and twelve bit- times corresponds to 51.2 microseconds on a 10 Mbit/s system. A (late) collision included in a count represented by an instance of this object is also considered as a (generic) collision for purposes of other collision-related statistics.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-ExcessiveCollisions:

``uint32`` **ExcessiveCollisions**

    The number of frames for which transmission on a particular interface fails due to excessive collisions.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-DeferredTransmissions:

``uint32`` **DeferredTransmissions**

    The number of frames for which the first transmission attempt on a particular interface is delayed because the medium is busy. The count represented by an instance of this object does not include frames involved in collisions.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-SingleCollisionFrames:

``uint32`` **SingleCollisionFrames**

    The number of successfully transmitted frames on a particular interface for which transmission is inhibited by exactly one collision. A frame that is counted by an instance of this object is not counted by the corresponding instance of the MultipleCollisionFrames property.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-PacketsReceived:

``uint64`` **PacketsReceived**

    The total number of packets that are received.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-PacketsTransmitted:

``uint64`` **PacketsTransmitted**

    The total number of packets that are transmitted.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-InternalMACReceiveErrors:

``uint32`` **InternalMACReceiveErrors**

    The number of frames for which reception on a particular interface fails due to an internal MAC sublayer receive error. A frame is counted by an instance of this object only if it is not counted by the corresponding instance of either the FrameTooLongs property, the AlignmentErrors property, or the FCSErrors property. The precise meaning of the count that is represented by an instance of this object is implementation-specific. For example, an instance of this object can represent a count of receive errors on a particular interface that are not otherwise counted.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-InternalMACTransmitErrors:

``uint32`` **InternalMACTransmitErrors**

    The number of frames for which transmission on a particular interface fails due to an internal MAC sublayer transmit error. A frame is counted by an instance of this object only if it is not counted by the corresponding instance of either the LateCollisions property, the Excessive Collisions property, or the CarrierSenseErrors property. The precise meaning of the count that is represented by an instance of this object is implementation-specific. In particular, an instance of this object can represent a count of transmission errors on a particular interface that are not otherwise counted.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-FrameTooLongs:

``uint32`` **FrameTooLongs**

    The number of frames received on a particular interface that exceed the maximum permitted frame size. The count represented by an instance of this object is incremented when the FrameTooLong status is returned by the MAC layer to the LLC (or other MAC user). Received frames for which multiple error conditions obtained are, according to the conventions of IEEE 802.3 Layer Management, counted exclusively according to the error status presented to the LLC.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-FCSErrors:

``uint32`` **FCSErrors**

    The number of frames that are received on a particular interface that are an integral number of octets in length, but do not pass the FCS check. The count represented by an instance of this object is incremented when the frame check error status is returned by the MAC layer to the LLC (or other MAC user). Received frames for which multiple error conditions obtained are, according to the conventions of the error status presented to the LLC.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-AlignmentErrors:

``uint32`` **AlignmentErrors**

    The number of frames that are received on a particular interface that are not an integral number of octets in length and do not pass the FCS check. The count represented by an instance of this object is incremented when the alignment error status is returned by the MAC layer to the LLC (or other MAC user). Received frames for which multiple error conditions obtained are, according to the conventions of IEEE 802.3 Layer Management, counted exclusively according to the error status presented to the LLC.

    
.. _CIM-EthernetPortStatistics-SymbolErrors:

``uint32`` **SymbolErrors**

    The number of times that there was an invalid data symbol when a valid carrier was present. The count can be incremented only once per carrier event, even if multiple symbol errors occur during the carrier event.
