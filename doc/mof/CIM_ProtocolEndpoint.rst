CIM_ProtocolEndpoint
--------------------

Class reference
===============
Subclass of :ref:`CIM_ServiceAccessPoint <CIM-ServiceAccessPoint>`

A communication point from which data can be sent or received. ProtocolEndpoints link system or computer interfaces to LogicalNetworks.

Local properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _CIM-ProtocolEndpoint-TimeOfLastStateChange:

``datetime`` **TimeOfLastStateChange**

    The date or time when the EnabledState of the element last changed. If the state of the element has not changed and this property is populated, then it must be set to a 0 interval value. If a state change was requested, but rejected or not yet processed, the property must not be updated.

    
.. _CIM-ProtocolEndpoint-Description:

``string`` **Description**

    The Description property provides a textual description of the object.

    
.. _CIM-ProtocolEndpoint-NameFormat:

``string`` **NameFormat**

    NameFormat contains the naming heuristic that is selected to ensure that the value of the Name property is unique. For example, you might choose to prepend the name of the port or interface with the Type of ProtocolEndpoint (for example, IPv4) of this instance followed by an underscore.

    
.. _CIM-ProtocolEndpoint-Name:

``string`` **Name**

    A string that identifies this ProtocolEndpoint with either a port or an interface on a device. To ensure uniqueness, the Name property should be prepended or appended with information from the Type or OtherTypeDescription properties. The method selected is described in the NameFormat property of this class.

    
.. _CIM-ProtocolEndpoint-ProtocolIFType:

``uint16`` **ProtocolIFType**

    ProtocolIFType is an enumeration that is synchronized with the IANA ifType MIB. The ifType MIB is maintained at the URL, http://www.iana.org/assignments/ianaiftype-mib. Also, additional values defined by the DMTF are included. The property is used to categorize and classify instances of the ProtocolEndpoint class. Note that if the ProtocolIFType is set to 1 (Other), then the type information should be provided in the OtherTypeDescription string property.

.. _CIM-ProtocolEndpoint-EnabledState:

``uint16`` **EnabledState**

    EnabledState is an integer enumeration that indicates the enabled and disabled states of an element. It can also indicate the transitions between these requested states. For example, shutting down (value=4) and starting (value=10) are transient states between enabled and disabled. The following text briefly summarizes the various enabled and disabled states: 

    Enabled (2) indicates that the element is or could be executing commands, will process any queued commands, and queues new requests. 

    Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests. 

    Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state. 

    Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled. 

    Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests. 

    Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. 

    Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. 

    Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode.

    Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued.

.. _CIM-ProtocolEndpoint-OtherTypeDescription:

``string`` **OtherTypeDescription**

    A string that describes the type of ProtocolEndpoint when the Type property of this class (or any of its subclasses) is set to 1 (Other). This property should be set to null when the Type property is any value other than 1.

    
.. _CIM-ProtocolEndpoint-BroadcastResetSupported:

``boolean`` **BroadcastResetSupported**

    A boolean indicating whether the instrumentation supports the BroadcastReset method.

    
.. _CIM-ProtocolEndpoint-ProtocolType:

``uint16`` **ProtocolType**

    Note: This property is deprecated in lieu of the ProtocolIFType enumeration. This deprecation was done to have better alignment between the IF-MIB of the IETF and this CIM class. 

    Deprecated description: ProtocolType is an enumeration that provides information to categorize and classify different instances of this class. For most instances, information in this enumeration and the definition of the subclass overlap. However, there are several cases where a specific subclass of ProtocolEndpoint is not required (for example, there is no Fibre Channel subclass of ProtocolEndpoint). Therefore, this property is needed to define the type of Endpoint.

    ======== =======================
    
.. _CIM-ProtocolEndpoint-OperationalStatus:

``uint16[]`` **OperationalStatus**

    Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 

    "Stressed" indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of "Stressed" states are overload, overheated, and so on. 

    "Predictive Failure" indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 

    "In Service" describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 

    "No Contact" indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 

    "Lost Communication" indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 

    "Stopped" and "Aborted" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 

    "Dormant" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 

    "Supporting Entity in Error" indicates that this element might be "OK" but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 

    "Completed" indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 

    "Power Mode" indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. 

    "Relocating" indicates the element is being relocated.

    OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element.
