OpenLMI
=======

**OpenLMI  = Open Linux Management Infrastructure.**

OpenLMI is open-source project aiming to improve management of Linux systems
using WBEM standards. We reuse many already available open-source WBEM
components, adding the missing ones and integrating them into one system
management solution.

In short, WBEM can be described as a *remote API for system management*.
See `WBEM overview <http://www.openlmi.org/node/1785>`_ for details.
