OpenLMI
=======

**OpenLMI  = Open Linux Management Infrastructure.**

OpenLMI is open-source project aiming to improve management of Linux systems
using WBEM standards. We reuse many already available open-source WBEM
components, adding the missing ones and integrating them into one system
management solution.

In short, WBEM can be described as a *remote API for system management*.
See `WBEM overview <http://www.openlmi.org/node/1785>`_ for details.


Client components
-----------------

There are many already existing tools and libraries to manage WBEM-enabled
hosts. see `WBEM overview <http://www.openlmi.org/node/1785>`_ for details.

OpenLMI project adds LMI metacommand and LMIShell.

:ref:`LMI metacommand <lmi_metacommand>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A command line utility to perform discovery and operations on remote managed
systems. For example, it can start a printing service on remote system:

::

    /usr/bin/lmi -h my.server.org service start cups

:ref:`LMI metacommand <lmi_metacommand>` users do not need to know anything
about WBEM, all the complexity is hidden inside.

:ref:`LMIShell <lmi_shell>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A high-level python-based WBEM client, that can be used for scripting or as an
interactive shell to manage remote systems. For example, one can write a script
to start a service:

::

    c = connect("my.server.org", "root", "opensesame")
    cups = c.root.cimv2.LMI_Service.first_instance({"Name" : "cups.service"})
    cups.StartService()

:ref:`LMIShell <lmi_shell>` users do not need to know anything about WBEM
transport protocols, however some knowledge about the aforementioned remote
API becomes necessary. In the example above, the script author must know that
system services are exposed as instances of :ref:`LMI_Service<LMI-Service>`
class with property :ref:`Name <CIM-Service-Name>` (the service name) and
method :ref:`StartService() <CIM-Service-StartService>` that starts the
service.

:ref:`Server components <lmi_server_components>`
------------------------------------------------

OpenLMI focuses on implementation of missing providers for networking, storage,
system services, packages and so on.
