Power Management command line reference
=======================================

``lmi power`` is a command for LMI metacommand, which allows to display and
control system power states on a remote host with installed
:ref:`OpenLMI power provider <openlmi-power-provider>`. It works only
if managed machine is up with *CIMOM* running inside its operating system.
Therefore powering the machine on is out of scope for *OpenLMI*.
