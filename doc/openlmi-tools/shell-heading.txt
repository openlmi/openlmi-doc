LMIShell
--------

.. only:: not man

    LMIShell provides a (non)interactive way how to access CIM objects provided
    by *OpenPegasus* or *sblim-sfcb* broker. The shell is based on a python
    interpreter and added logic, therefore what you can do in pure python, it
    is possible in LMIShell. There are classes added to manipulate with CIM
    classes, instance names, instances, etc.  Additional classes are added to
    fulfill wrapper pattern and expose only those methods, which are necessary
    for the purpose of a shell.

    **Short example:**

    .. code-block:: python

        $ lmishell
        > c = connect('localhost', 'root', 'password')
        > for proc in c.root.cimv2.LMI_Processor.instances():
        ...   print "Name:\t%s, Clock Speed:\t%s" % (proc.Name, proc.MaxClockSpeed)
        ...
        Name:   QEMU Virtual CPU version 1.6.2, Clock Speed:    2000
        Name:   QEMU Virtual CPU version 1.6.2, Clock Speed:    2000
