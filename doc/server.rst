OpenLMI server components
=========================

On servers (= managed systems), OpenLMI leverages WBEM infrastructure we already
have in Linux and only adds the missing pieces: providers.

See our `overview <http://www.openlmi.org/node/1785>`_ for details what is
a provider and how the whole CIM+WBEM infrastructure is supposed to work.
